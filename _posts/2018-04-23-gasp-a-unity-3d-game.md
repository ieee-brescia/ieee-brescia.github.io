## Overview
GaSP (acronym for GAme Student Project) is a project that aims to build a videogame using the Unity3D game engine. The game wants to be a 2D platformer with a minimalistic art style and with time rewind mechanics.

The player will be able to rewind and slow down time for a limited period of time, and all the gameplay challenges will be based on that. The game is being developed in C# with the help of the Unity3D interface.

### Skills
If you plan to work on this project you will most likely develop the following skills: 

* Decent knowledge of the Unity3D game engine;
* Object oriented programming and C# knowledge;
* Base details of game design;
